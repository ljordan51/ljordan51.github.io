        <p>Fortunately, a previous team had already started to explore what a real-time air quality user interface might
          look like. Here's a look at some of the prior art we started with.</p>

                  <p>Air quality data and its health impacts are incredibly complicated. There isn't necessarily a
                    correlation between different pollutant concentrations and they depend on environmental factors.
                    Additionally, the impacts are unsurprisingly time dependent.</p>

                      <li>They draw attention to the current value to build familiarity with units.</li>
                      <li>The average line and percent difference on the graph build intuition for the severity of
                        different values.</li>

                    <li>The cloud is a large focal element but doesn't add any information.</li>
                    <li>Although it can be backed out from the percent difference, the average value should be displayed
                      if it's being used as a reference to build intuition.</li>
                    <li>The wind data is not useful without direction and would be better displayed on a map.</li>
                    <li>There is no way to learn more about the sources, impacts, health standards, and mitigation
                      strategies related to this pollutant.</li>

                  <p>This view was intended to provide a summary of critical pollutants. By making space for a reduced
                    set of information on a single page, users might be able to make quicker decisions.</p>
                  <div class="d-none d-xl-initial">
                    <h6>What they got right:</h6>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Like the view on the previous slide, the units, average line, and percent difference build
                        intuition. Plus the average value is included here.</li>
                      <li>The atmospheric data builds confidence in the reliability and immediacy of the air quality
                        data.

                  <ul>
                    <li>Color is always a concern when considering universal design.</li>
                    <li>The circular shape of the bubbles wastes a lot of space. For mobile UI design, this can be
                      fatal. You may notice that this mockup is actually wider than the others and has more of a tablet
                      aspect ratio.</li>
                    <li>There is no way on this page to tell how the levels are changing.</li>
                    <li>It's not clear how old the data is and how to refresh it.</li>

                      referenced against. Additionally, there is no way to know how serious a certain percentage is.
                      Lastly, there is no guarantee positive and negative will map the same for each person.</li>
                    <li>Besides the "Trend" button, there are no affordances showing where to go for more information.

          <div class="text">
            <p class="d-none d-md-initial">Wizard of Oz testing is one of the most powerful UX design techniques I've
              encountered. It doesn't hurt
              that it's also super fun. The basic idea is that you can rapidly prototype many different things if you
              use yourself to fill in the gaps in functionality that a complete design would have. In the case of basic
              UI design, this looks like some paper wireframes that you manipulate as your users touch parts of the
              screen. However, you can quickly increase the complexity by using sticky notes and clear sheets to mimic
              things like dropdowns and modals. Since everything is on paper, edits and re-designs can be immediately
              co-created with users.
            </p>
            <p>Before making a bunch of blind changes to our UI, we needed to get input from users. We wanted to utilize
              these existing wireframes as a platform for understanding how our users would interact with real-time air
              quality data. We, of course, interviewed them to understand them as people and their conceptions of air
              quality better before showing them the wireframes. Before heading out, we hypothesized that some users
              may be overwhelmed by looking at any data. Therefore, we quickly mocked this additional view (just as an
              experiment) to give clear actionable information without any data.</p>
            <h6>What we learned:</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>Most users were overwhelmed by the views with numbers and graphs; although, some had a desire to
                learn how to interpret them.</li>
              <li>Everyone had a strong desire for recommendations about what to do.</li>
              <li>Many people reacted well to the at-a-glance view but at least one person felt more sure seeing the
                numbers.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Due to COVID-19, we were forced to take our remaining planned user interactions virtual. <span
                class="d-xl-initial"> We have very
                strong partners in this work in East Boston. Some of the big ones are Mothers Out Front and AIR, Inc,
                which are both activist organizations fighting the big polluters in their communities. We
                were fortunate to get the chance to do Zoom calls with members of each organization in which we were
                able
                to interview them and then watch (and record) them interacting with the prototype. </span> We quickly
              converted
              our designs into a fully-automated standalone UI wireframe in Figma for this remote user testing.

            <h6>Design insights:</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>These more knowledgeable users were still interested in basic information for immediate
                decision-making, like whether pollutant concentrations are increasing or decreasing.</li>
              <li>There is a desire to implicate sources with the data to serve activist work. However, the features it
                would require are beyond our scope and this work is better served by historical data analysis.</li>
              <li>The app needs to have an educational mindset; in particular, people want to know what levels are
                healthy and from where pollution is coming.</li>

            <div class="d-none d-xl-initial">
              <p>Virtual user testing was really interesting and it's something I'm interested in continuing to explore!
                Althouogh we were skeptical of it at first, there are always silver linings. Here are some of the pros
                and
                cons from our experience.</p>
              <h6>Pros:</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>Screen-sharing eliminates having to watch over a user's shoulder or observe the prototype upside
                  down
                  from across a table.</li>
                <li>Recording is easy and not a weird ask. Plus, people can easily turn video sharing off.</li>
                <li>It's way easier to schedule virtual testing.</li>
              </ul>
              <h6>Cons:</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>It's not accessible to people technological limitations (wifi speed, computer access, comfort using
                  desktop and web applications).</li>
                <li>It's harder to reach people outside your existing network. In person introductions are much more
                  effective.</li>
                <li>It's harder to get a user group together and bang out back-to-back tests.</li>

        <p>After all this user testing, it was critical to develop personas to solidify the user stories we heard. From
          these three personas, we were able to develop a set of requirements for a first release of our real-time air
          quality data platform:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An at-a-glance view with, at minimum, information on how levels have been changing in a recent time period
            (exact time period to be determined from further data analysis) and
            recommendations for mitigating exposure to pollutants</li>
          <li>Obvious communication of most recent data timestamp and method for manually refreshing the view</li>
          <li>Current pollutant levels compared to one or a combination of the following: local averages, health
            standards, understandable comparisons (e.g. a forest).</li>
          <li>A map view which incorporates wind direction and ideally incorporates the at-a-glance view</li>
          <li>Clear ways to access educational information about sources, impacts, and health standards</li>

                know where to start and can get overwhelmed from just looking at data. Taylor needs recommendations to
                protect themself and the kids but wants to be confident in the reasoning behind them. However, Taylor

                time and is frustrated by the air quality problem. Alex wants to use the data to understand trends,
                sources, and implicate big polluters. Alex may have kids but they're probably old enough to be taking
                care of themselves. Alex is pretty good with technology and picks things up quickly.</p>

        <h1>Redesign</h1>
        <p>Since developing our requirements, we've put most design work on hold while we build the back-end to serve
          data to our application and create a front-end framework which can be easily updated and tested with the first
          release design. That being said, we have done some preliminary design work to explore potential directions for
          our redesign.

        <h2>At-A-Glance</h2>
        <p>In all these at-a-glance mockups, you'll notice the information hierarchy. The recommendations are the first
          things our users will be looking for, but they take up a lot of space on the page. We could hide the data
          initially and let users expand it but the purpose of this whole project is to provide an intuitive platform
          for interacting with the data. Therefore, recommendations are collapsed initially but shown at the top of the
          screen with an expansion arrow as a clear affordance to access them. Additionally, the last updated time and a
          refresh button sit at the top of the data section to provide context and control for immediate decision
          making.</p>
